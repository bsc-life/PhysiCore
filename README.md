# PhysiCore

**PhysiCore** is a modern re-architecture of the [PhysiCell](http://physicell.org) agent-based simulation framework, built for flexibility, performance, and clarity.
It introduces a cleaner, modular codebase that supports **interchangeable diffusion and mechanics models**, making it easy to experiment with new numerical methods, physical formulations, and biological processes without overhauling the entire simulation engine.

## Key Features

- **Modernized core architecture** – streamlined, maintainable, and extensible.
- **Pluggable diffusion solvers** – swap between FEM, FVM, FDM, or custom schemes.
- **Interchangeable mechanics engines** – easily test alternative force models and integration methods.
- **Performance-friendly design** – ready for HPC, vectorization, and GPU offload.
- **Clear separation of concerns** – clean interfaces between core simulation logic and numerical backends.

## Vision

PhysiCore aims to be the go-to foundation for **next-generation, high-performance multicellular simulations**, enabling researchers to focus on science instead of wrestling with legacy code.
