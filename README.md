# PhysiCore

**PhysiCore** is a modern re-architecture of the [PhysiCell](http://physicell.org) agent-based simulation framework, built for flexibility, performance, and clarity.
It introduces a cleaner, modular codebase that supports **interchangeable diffusion and mechanics models**, making it easy to experiment with new numerical methods, physical formulations, and biological processes without overhauling the entire simulation engine.

---

## Key Features

- **Modernized core architecture** – streamlined, maintainable, and extensible.
- **Pluggable diffusion solvers** – swap between FEM, FVM, FDM, or custom schemes.
- **Interchangeable mechanics engines** – easily test alternative force models and integration methods.
- **Performance-friendly design** – ready for HPC, vectorization, and GPU offload.
- **Clear separation of concerns** – clean interfaces between core simulation logic and numerical backends.

---

## Vision

PhysiCore aims to be the go-to foundation for **next-generation, high-performance multicellular simulations**, enabling researchers to focus on science instead of wrestling with legacy code.

## Dependencies and vcpkg

This project uses vcpkg in manifest mode. CMake presets automatically point to the vcpkg toolchain via the environment variable `VCPKG_ROOT`.

- If you already have vcpkg installed, ensure `VCPKG_ROOT` points to it.
- If not, you can use the repo-local copy under `./vcpkg` (recommended for reproducibility).

Set up on Linux/macOS (zsh):

```sh
# Option A: use the repo-local vcpkg
export VCPKG_ROOT="$PWD/vcpkg"
"$VCPKG_ROOT"/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh

# Option B: point to your existing vcpkg install
export VCPKG_ROOT="/path/to/your/vcpkg"
```

Set up on Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Option A: repo-local vcpkg
$env:VCPKG_ROOT = "$PWD/vcpkg"
& "$env:VCPKG_ROOT/bootstrap-vcpkg.bat"

# Option B: existing vcpkg install
$env:VCPKG_ROOT = "C:\\path\\to\\vcpkg"
```

Manifest dependencies (from `vcpkg.json`):

- `cccl` - NVIDIA Thrust library for TBB and CUDA backends
- `gtest` - Testing framework
- `highway` - Vendor-agnostic vectorization library
- `noarr-structures` - Memory layouts library
- `tbb` - Intel OneAPI Threading Building Blocks
- `vtk-ioxml` - VTK IO for BioFVM serializer

Notes
- The repo ships `vcpkg-configuration.json` with a pinned baseline and `ports-overlays/` for custom/overlay ports.
- On first configure, vcpkg will build and install dependencies for your preset under `build/<preset>/vcpkg_installed/`.


## Build

Prerequisites
- CMake with presets support, a C++20 compiler (GCC/Clang/MSVC), and Ninja (presets use the Ninja generator).
- vcpkg available via `VCPKG_ROOT` as described above.

Common flows (Linux/macOS, zsh):

```sh
# Configure + build (GCC release)
cmake --preset=gcc-release
cmake --build --preset=gcc-release

# Run tests
ctest --preset gcc-release --output-on-failure

# Full configure+build+test workflow in one step
cmake --workflow --preset=gcc-release
```

Other useful presets (see `CMakePresets.json`):
- `llvm-{debug,release}` for clang compilation
- `gcc-{debug,release}` for gcc compilation
- `appleclang-{debug,release}` for AppleClang compilation
- `msvc-{debug,release}` for Microsoft cl compilation

## Example Projects

The repository provides several example projects under `examples/` to demonstrate PhysiCore's capabilities:

### Diffussion

A simple example showcasing diffusion of a single substrate in a 3D domain with static cells acting as sources and sinks. It runs a 30m simulation and outputs VTK-compatible file.
To build and run:

```sh
cmake --preset=gcc-release
cmake --build --preset=gcc-release --target physicore.reactions-diffusion.biofvm.diffuse
build/gcc-release/reactions-diffusion/biofvm/examples/physicore.reactions-diffusion.biofvm.diffuse
```

The run generates `output/` with VTK files for visualization.
