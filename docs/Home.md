# PhysiCore Documentation

Welcome to the **PhysiCore** documentation! PhysiCore is a modern C++20 re-architecture of the [PhysiCell](http://physicell.org) agent-based multicellular simulation framework, designed for flexibility, performance, and clarity.

## What is PhysiCore?

PhysiCore provides a modular foundation for high-performance multicellular simulations with:

- **Clean, modern architecture** - Built with C++20 standards for maintainability and extensibility
- **Pluggable diffusion solvers** - Swap between different numerical methods (FEM, FVM, FDM) without rewriting your simulation
- **Interchangeable mechanics engines** - Easily experiment with alternative force models and integration methods
- **Performance-ready** - Designed for HPC environments with support for vectorization and GPU acceleration
- **Clear separation of concerns** - Well-defined interfaces between simulation logic and numerical backends

## Vision

PhysiCore aims to be the foundation for **next-generation, high-performance multicellular simulations**, enabling researchers to focus on biological modeling rather than wrestling with complex software architecture.
